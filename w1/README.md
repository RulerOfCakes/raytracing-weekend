# Ray Tracing in One Weekend

My implementation of [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley.

Mostly follows the book with C++.

To render an image, run the following command with your filename of choice(without the curly brackets)

```sh
just render {FILENAME}
```
